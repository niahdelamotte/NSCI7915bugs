Associated with Jaco Le Roux's lab - majority of data used was collected by Niah Delamotte, with contributions to the running of the project itself including from: Jaco Le Roux, Dylan Geraghty, Levi Brown, Maria Lambos, Sigrid Iredell, Rowan Clarke.
Data was collected between the 8th of January until the 4th of March, 2024.
Keywords: temperature, thermal tolerance, climate, entomology, development, diet, native, invasive, host plant

The dataset's first column, 'Code', refers to the code used to identify each individual sample. Following on are two independent variables, 'Diet' and 'Temp'. Diet refers to a diet of Cardiospermum grandiflorum seed denoted by 'C', or a diet of Alectryon tomentosus denoted by 'A'. Temp refers to temperature treatments which gradually increase from control, low, moderate to high, increasing by 1.8, 2.7, and 3.6 degrees Celsuis accompanied by an increases in peak temperatures. 

'Hatched' indicates whether a sample egg hatched with 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no. 'F2S' refers to the number of days an individual took from hatching to their first moult into a second instar. 'S2T' refers to the number of days an individual took to develop from a second to a third instar. 'T2Fo' refers to the number of days an individual took to develop from a third to a fourth instar. 'Fi2A' refers to the number of days an individual took to develop from a fifth instar to their final moult into an adult bug. 'F2A' refers to the total number of days a bug took from their hatch date to reach maturity. 'Death_stage' refers to bugs that died during the data collection time for tracking their development, and indicates which instar stage a nymph died at.

'Sex' refers to the sex of an individual, which was only acquired if the bug reached maturity within the allotted time; 'F' refers to females, while 'M' refers to males. 'PL' is an abbreviation for proboscis length and is  measured in milimetres. 'BL' is an abbreviation for body length and is measured in milimetres. 'PW' is an abbreviation for pronotum width and is measured in milimetres.
